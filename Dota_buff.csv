0,95758502,Basically what the other side did was at :30 game time they would have 1 pos 4 constantly drag the creep wave from the enemy safe lane to mid. What ends up happening is mid has 2 waves of creeps which would instantly kill the current wave and push to between t1 and t2. This would result in the mid lane getting a lot of exp while the enemy mid being deny exp. the offlane makes up for this by pulling the creep wave to the side jungle. Offlane a bit underlevel but the mid is like lvl 6 when thr enemy is lvl 4 sometimes 3.
1,112119309,"if that's happening then :1. the said pos 4 must be in the enemy's vision to aggro the creep2. that pos 4 must leave the mid immediately after taking them there3. that pos 4 must be very under leveled enough for your mid to kill by level 3 given him/her has simple cc (this is the counter)4. kill that pos 4, and the whole strat is plain useless5. if (4) didn't happen, your mid sucks, or at least an ignorant.6. your safelane is against one man army, kill him (likeliness if you have MK + Veno or anything alike)"
2,130945653,Kinda wanna try this in unranked. Curious starving enemy safelane and buffing your midlane.
3,95758502,how will you kill the pos 4? he is behind the t2 tower. If you actually run away him he probably tp away and you just lost entire wave if not 2 waves of cs and exp. 
4,112119309,"he is behind the t2 towerDude, I tried this, there is no way that pos 4 instantly get there, it goes a long way down from top or bot safelane, sometimes with low HP, your pos 5 can also help to kill the guy, but yes, you have a point, it's a risky bet that your pos 5 can take instead"
5,112119309,"and also yes, it's a good strat, even more with an escapee pos 4 like phoenix"
6,298188215,Your offlane will automatically suffer more so there's not much to counter other than punishing offlane harder.
