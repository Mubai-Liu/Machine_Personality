He can download any free to play and do just about anything within the programming. Now mind you rules exist to be enforced. OP can ruin till the cows come home, but there will be aftermaths from it. Valve is everyone's game. Not just OP's. Want to be an active ruiner? Prepaid to have that mmr drop and collect that low priority. But if i do this and end in lp i'll just get mad and buy a bunch of accounts. Why Valve want to force me to buy account? Just let me free to ruin and i'll be a good boy."
817,76561197982133618,"Originally posted by Only noobs play dota:Well, that's pretty much all. I should have the right to ruin other people games for my fun. Valve is a damn tyrant, if i want to feed and waste other 9 people time i should be allowed to do so. The more they keep doing this, the more people will leave the game. Being toxic and a ruiner is the only value Dota has. If you remove ruiners nobody will keep playing Dota. I mean, dota is a dumb game for naabs, the only decent thing is that you can ruin the game for other 9 players, why the hell punish somebody for doing the only funny thing? Ragequiting and feeding getting already normal in Dota 2. What do you think you would archive? You will be only the trend nothing else."

Why Valve want to force me to buy account? Just let me free to ruin and i'll be a good boy. What you ask is selfish in nature and destucive in practice. Team based game caters to the many not the few. Be ruinous. Buy accounts. Make accounts. Idc. I'll never see you in my games personally. Why you think you wouldn't get me in your games?
819,76561198132601646,"How does Valve not allow you to ruin other people's games? Players brag they are smurfing, how do they do that? Valve bans accounts, do they actually ban players?   "
